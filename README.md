## üìã Overview

**CodeGraph Analyzer** is a powerful static analysis engine that transforms your codebase into a rich, queryable Neo4j graph database. It now supports **multiple programming languages and frameworks**, creating a comprehensive "digital twin" of your entire software ecosystem. This enables unprecedented code comprehension, visualization, and AI-driven development workflows across complex, multi-language projects.

## üåü What's New: Multi-Language Support

CodeGraph Analyzer now provides robust support for a wide spectrum of programming languages and frameworks:

### Programming Languages
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Full support for modern TS/JS features with ts-morph
- **Python** - Complete parsing via Python's native AST module
- **Java** - Advanced analysis using tree-sitter-java
- **C#** - Comprehensive parsing with tree-sitter-c-sharp
- **C/C++** - Detailed analysis of headers, includes, and implementation
- **Go** - Complete structure and package relationship mapping
- **SQL** - Table, view, and query analysis from SQL files
- **HTML/CSS** - Structure and style mapping

### Frameworks & Technologies
- **React/Preact** - Component hierarchies, JSX elements, prop mapping
- **Tailwind CSS** - Class usage and relationships
- **Supabase** - Database schema and API relationships
- **Deno** - Module, import, and runtime analysis

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Cross-Language Analysis**: Analyze relationships between different languages in the same project
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Intelligently identifies supported file types across your entire project
- **Two-Pass Analysis**: First builds detailed ASTs for each file, then resolves complex cross-file relationships
- **Rich Element Identification**: Extracts files, directories, classes, interfaces, functions, methods, variables, parameters, type aliases, components, SQL tables, and more
- **Relationship Mapping**: Maps IMPORTS, EXPORTS, CALLS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, RENDERS_ELEMENT, USES_COMPONENT, REFERENCES_TABLE, and many others
- **Neo4j Integration**: Creates a queryable knowledge graph with optimized schema management
- **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly with Model Context Protocol for AI-powered codebase interaction

## üîç Why Multi-Language Support Matters

Modern software development rarely happens in a single language. The expanded language support in CodeGraph Analyzer addresses critical challenges:

- **Unified View**: See your entire tech stack as a coherent system instead of isolated silos
- **Cross-Language Dependencies**: Trace relationships between frontend and backend components (e.g., React components calling Python APIs)
- **Microservice Architecture**: Understand service boundaries and communication patterns across different languages
- **Multi-Team Collaboration**: Enable specialists in different languages to see how their code impacts the broader system
- **Legacy Integration**: Map connections between newer and older components written in different languages
- **Complete AI Context**: Give AI assistants holistic understanding of your entire codebase regardless of language

## üìà Visualize, Understand, and Talk to Your Entire Codebase

With CodeGraph Analyzer, you can:

- **Navigate Complex Systems**: Easily explore relationships across language boundaries
- **Perform Intelligent Refactoring**: Understand the full impact of changes across your tech stack
- **Onboard Developers Faster**: Help new team members grasp the architecture regardless of their language expertise
- **Empower AI Assistance**: Enable AI tools to understand your codebase at a deeper level
- **Document Automatically**: Generate architecture diagrams that span language boundaries
- **Ensure Architectural Compliance**: Verify cross-language dependencies adhere to your design principles

## üß† The Power of Neo4j MCP: Natural Language ‚Üí Code Understanding

The true breakthrough of CodeGraph isn't just in what languages it parses, but in how it enables AI to **truly understand your code** through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Neo4j.

### How It Works: The Neural Bridge Between Human, AI, and Code

1. **Natural Language ‚Üí Cypher Translation**: When you ask your AI assistant a question about your codebase ("How does the login system work?"), the Neo4j MCP tools automatically translate this into optimized Cypher queries.

2. **Knowledge Graph Traversal**: These queries intelligently navigate the comprehensive code graph that CodeGraph has built, finding exactly the code relationships that answer your question.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The AI receives the precise code context it needs - not just individual files, but the actual relationships, dependencies, and structures that connect them.

4. **Intelligent Response**: With this deep structural understanding, the AI can provide accurate, contextualized answers and generate code that respects your existing architecture.

### Why This Matters: Unprecedented AI Capabilities

- **Beyond Text Understanding**: AI no longer just reads code as text - it sees the actual structure and relationships between components
  
- **True Code Comprehension**: AI assistants can "see" how your Python backend connects to your React frontend, how data flows through your system, and what would break if you changed a specific function

- **Architectural Awareness**: Generate code that respects your existing patterns and integrates properly with your architecture, without breaking hidden dependencies

- **Intelligent Refactoring**: AI can confidently recommend refactoring across language boundaries, understanding the full impact of changes

- **Complexity Navigation**: Handle questions about massive codebases no human could fully keep in their head ("Show me all places where user data is accessed across our entire stack")

### Example Queries That Become Possible

```
"Show me all React components that fetch data from our Python API endpoints"

"Which SQL queries modify the user table and what services call them?"

"How does data flow from our frontend form to the database?"

"What would break if I changed the return type of this C++ function?"

"Generate a new endpoint that follows our existing API patterns"
```

Each of these questions is automatically translated to precise Cypher queries, enabling your AI assistant to provide accurate, contextual responses based on your actual codebase architecture - not just guesswork.

## üîÑ Neo4j MCP Integration: The Technical Details

### The Complete AI-Codebase Intelligence Stack

CodeGraph Analyzer works together with two critical MCP components to create a complete code understanding system:
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j)

1. **code-analyzer-mcp**: This MCP server provides AI assistants with the ability to:
   - Trigger codebase analysis on demand
   - Watch for code changes to keep the knowledge graph updated
   - Customize analysis parameters without requiring technical knowledge

2. **github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j**: This powerful MCP server is the bridge between natural language and code knowledge, providing:
   - **read-neo4j-cypher**: Translates natural questions into Cypher queries that extract precisely the right information
   - **write-neo4j-cypher**: Enables AI to update the knowledge graph as needed
   - **get-neo4j-schema**: Allows AI to understand the structure of your code graph

### Simplified Setup with Integrated Configuration

The CodeGraph setup package includes pre-configured MCP settings for both servers, enabling seamless integration with AI assistants. A typical configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j": {
      "command": "mcp-neo4j-cypher",
      "args": [

      ]
    },
    "code-analyzer-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "c:/code/amcp/mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],

      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "run_analyzer",
        "start_watcher",
        "stop_watcher"
      ]
    }
